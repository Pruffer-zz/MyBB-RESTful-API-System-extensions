# MyBB-RESTful-API-System-extensions

Extensions for MyBB-RESTful-API-System. Moved over from my fork.

Versions of the original APIs modified to use mostly JSON-type input included as well. I'll make docs for those sometime.

`restfulapi.php` file modified to add a setting for the new APIs.

I'm most definitely not a security researcher, though. If you absolutely need to use these, **make sure it's safe to do so first**.
